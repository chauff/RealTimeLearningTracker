# Real-Time Learning Tracker

The Real-Time Learning Tracker is an interactive learning widget that can be intergrated in a learner dashboard destined for MOOC learners on the  edX  platform.  This real-time feedback mechanism for edX learners consists of three different feedback complexity versions and each one of them uses low-level data from trace logs and converts it into behavioural indicators that describe several learning habits of the learners. By means of a bar chart appearing in a pop-up window at the bottom right of every MOOC page, provides learners with real-time feedback on their learning behaviour comparing it to previously successful learners. 

The Complex version of the Real-Time Learning Tracker is presented in action via this screencast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlhfIt9iCAE&t=53s
