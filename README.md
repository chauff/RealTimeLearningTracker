# Real-Time Learning Tracker


The *Real-Time Learning Tracker* is an interactive learning widget that can be intergrated in a learner dashboard destined for MOOC learners on the  edX  platform.  This **real-time** feedback mechanism for edX learners consists of three different feedback complexity versions and each one of them uses low-level data from trace logs and converts it into behavioural indicators that describe several learning habits of the learners. By means of a bar chart appearing in a pop-up window at the bottom right of every MOOC page, it provides learners with real-time feedback on their learning behaviour comparing it to previously successful learners. 

The Complex version of the *Real-Time Learning Tracker* is presented in action via this screencast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlhfIt9iCAE&t=53s

## Functional Architecture

The working architecture of the *Real-Time Learning Tracker* has three components as shown in the figure below.

1. **edX component (Javascript)**
	- contains the code responsible for real-time logging learners’ activity during the course.
	- contains the calculation of the metric values of each active learner in the course from 	the logged activity data 
	- loads each version (complex-intermediate-simple) of the *Real-Time Learning Tracker* on the edX pages in a pop-up window, based on learner’s edX id.

2. **Server backend (Javascript)**
	- developed with the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server environment, the back-end is 
	the part of the *Real-Time Learning Tracker* responsible for managing requests.
	- new events traced from the **real-time logger** code are logged to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database and all the  necessary logs for the learners’ metric computation as well as the **Average** and the **Most Engaged Graduate** profiles are sent back to the client.
3. **Local component (Python)**
	- the successful learner profiles (**Average** and **Most Engaged Graduate**) are generated by calculating the metric values from low-level activity data form a previous edition of the course and are inserted into the MongoDB database.
