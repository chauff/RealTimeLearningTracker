# Real-Time Learning Tracker


The *Real-Time Learning Tracker* is an interactive learning widget that can be intergrated in a learner dashboard destined for MOOC learners on the  edX  platform.  This **real-time** feedback mechanism for edX learners consists of three different feedback complexity versions and each one of them uses low-level data from trace logs and converts it into behavioural indicators that describe several learning habits of the learners. By means of a bar chart appearing in a pop-up window at the bottom right of every MOOC page, it provides learners with real-time feedback on their learning behaviour comparing it to previously successful learners. 

The Complex version of the *Real-Time Learning Tracker* is presented in action via this screencast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlhfIt9iCAE&t=53s

## Functional Architecture

The working architecture of the *Real-Time Learning Tracker* has three components as shown in the figure below.

![alt text](https://github.com/gatou92/RealTimeLearningTracker/blob/master/images/RLT_FuncionalArchitecture.jpg)
 
1. **edX component (Javascript)**
	- contains the code responsible for real-time logging learners’ activity during the course.
	- contains the calculation of the metric values of each active learner in the course from 	the logged activity data 
	- loads each version (complex-intermediate-simple) of the *Real-Time Learning Tracker* on the edX pages in a pop-up window, based on learner’s edX id.

	The widget is plotted using [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com). The documentation for customizing the widget is [here](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/).

	Each version of the widget is included in the files [complex_version](https://github.com/gatou92/RealTimeLearningTracker/blob/master/edX_MOOC_pages/public/js/complex_version.js), [intermediate_version](https://github.com/gatou92/RealTimeLearningTracker/blob/master/edX_MOOC_pages/public/js/intermediate_version.js) and [simple_version](https://github.com/gatou92/RealTimeLearningTracker/blob/master/edX_MOOC_pages/public/js/simple_version.js) respectively.

2. **Server backend (Javascript)**
	- developed with the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server environment, the back-end is 
	the part of the *Real-Time Learning Tracker* responsible for managing requests.
	- each time a new event is traced from the *real-time logger* code, an ajax POST request is sent to the Node server which inturn logs the corresponding event to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database.
	- on the other hand, during the widget generation step, an ajax GET request is sent to the server for acquiring the necessary logs for the learners’ metric computation.
	- in the same GET request also the already computed *Average* and *Most Engaged Graduate* profiles are retrieved

	The code for the server is included in the folder [Backend](https://github.com/gatou92/RealTimeLearningTracker/tree/master/Backend).

3. **Local component (Python)**
	- the successful learner profiles (**Average** and **Most Engaged Graduate**) are generated by calculating the metric values from low-level activity data form a previous edition of the edX course and are inserted into the MongoDB database.

	The code for the local, offline component is included in the folder [Offline_Computation](https://github.com/gatou92/RealTimeLearningTracker/tree/master/Offline_Computation). The current implementation calculates 7 metrics as presented below. 


## Metrics available

The metrics are calculated considering data generated from the first day of the course.

1. Number of video lecture watched
2. Number of quiz questions submitted
3. Amount of time spent on the course pages (in minutes)
4. Amount of time spent watching video lectures (in minutes)
5. The ratio of time spent watching video lectures while on the course pages (%)
6. The amount of forum contributions (#threads/#responses/#comments created) on the course pages
7. The ratio of learners' Engagement (%) - aggregated activity during the course computed based on all six aforementioned behavioural indicators
